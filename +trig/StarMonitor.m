classdef StarMonitor < handle
% Collect some additional info about specific stars during an analysis run.
% This object is part of trig.EventFinder, and will always get the photometric
% data + processed cutouts for each batch. If the star_indices prop is
% empty then it does nothing. 
% If there are some star indices then it will save the flux and auxiliary
% data for that star for all batches in the run. 
% If any events trigger at this star it will also save those Candidate
% objects but with added "cutouts_all" that includes cutouts for all stars
% in the time period of the event. 
%
% NOTE: the data is only collected after the burn-in period. The star
%       indices are therefore in the reduced list of stars. Make sure the
%       index you give is from that list, not from the list of all stars!
