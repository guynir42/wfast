classdef PSDCorrector < handle
% Use Welch's method on a buffer of previous fluxes to get an estimate for 
% the Power Spectral Desnity (PSD) of the flux of each star. 
% You will need to keep quite a few samples of previous fluxes to get a good
% estimate of the PSD. This is controlled by "N_buf" and "B_min". 
% The former determines the maximum buffer size, and the latter determines
% the minimal buffer size that allows using the PSD. 
% In the first few batches the PSD is not used, until reaching "N_min". 
% Then after we reach "N_buf" samples in the buffer, the PSD correction is
% at full power, and remains so until the end of the run. Any new flux data
% that comes into this object is stored in a FIFO buffer. 
%
% Use input(flux) to give the newest batch of fluxes to this object. Make 
% sure to define "num_frames_to_add" as the number of flux points in a single
% batch, so it only inputs one batch at a time to the PSD calculation, not
% the overlapping two-batch we usually work with. The two-batch is indeed 
% given to input() but only so it can be calibrated (de-reddened) using the
% PSD we have already calculated on previous batches. 
%
% Use the "fluxes_deredened" for fluxes corrected by the sqrt of the PSD. 
% Use the "fluxes_blued" for fluxes with double correction (extra red removal) 
% which is useful for accounting also for the filter that should be divided 
% by sqrt of the PSD. Thus the "blued" fluxes can be match-filtered directly. 
% See Barak's paper: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190805644Z/abstract
%
% NOTE: we use a linear fit (excluding outliers) to calibrate the fluxes
% before putting them into the PSD. If the flux buffer is too short for 
% getting a good PSD estimate (at the beginning of the run) then we return
% the fluxes with only this simple calibration. If the PSD is applied, it is
% applied to the calibrated fluxes. 
% 
% The PSD itself is stored in "psd" and can be plotted for inspection.
