classdef AstroData < dynamicprops
% Contains all the outputs from image analysis (images, cutouts, etc.)
% Since the long and ever expanding list of data products is shared by
% several objects (file.Reader, file.BufferWheel, file.Deflator,
% img.PipeLine, etc.) it is helpful to keep these outputs all in one place.
% 
% These properties are all meant to contain data for a single batch, 
% so it would have one image in the "stack", 100 images and timestamps, etc. 
%
% NOTE: this object and all its sub-clasess (inheritors) get the dynamicprops
%       ability to add properties when needed. This is useful when doing 
%       custom analysis and need temporary variables to be stored with the 
%       regular data products. 

    properties % these include all the images, cutouts, lightcurves, etc that we use in image analysis
        
        % make sure anything you add is added to clear...
        images; % this is raw images and it is usually what we save on file
        
        timestamps; % output timestamps (if available)
        t_start; % absolute date and time (UTC) when first image is taken
        t_end; % absolute date and time (UTC) when batch is finished
        t_end_stamp; % timestamp when batch is finished (hopefully, this is the same time that t_end is recorded). 
         
        juldates; % translation of timestamps to julian date using t_end_stamp
        
        stack % sum of the full frame image
        num_sum; % if the images are summed, how many frames were added. If equal to 1, the sum is the same as the images. 
        
        cutouts; % this is raw cutouts and it is usually what we save on file
        positions; % only for cutouts. a 2xN matrix (X then Y, N is the number of cutouts). 
        coordinates; % match each star/cutout position with RA/DEC (in degrees)
        magnitudes; % each star's magnitude (from catalog)
        temperatures; % each star's temperature in K (from catalog)
        object_idx; % what is the index of the object closest to the coordinates given
        
        cutouts_bg; % samples of the raw images at random locations to calculate the backgrounds
        positions_bg; % only for bg_cutouts. a 2xN matrix (X then Y, N is the number of cutouts). 
        
        psfs; % output PSFs from file (if available)
        sampling_psf; % if loaded PSFs need to be binned (this is the binning factor)
        
        % these are photometric products for each batch
        fluxes; % amount of light (total) in each cutout
        errors; % error estimate on the flux measurements
        areas; % aperture area 
        backgrounds; % value of the average number of photons per pixel (of the background)
        variances; % value of the average variance per pixel (of the background)
        offsets_x; % measured inside the cutout (in pixels)
        offsets_y; % measured inside the cutout (in pixels)
        centroids_x; % measured relative to the full image (in pixels)
        centroids_y; % measured relative to the full image (in pixels)
        widths; % the second moment of the PSF
        bad_pixels; % how many bad pixels are included in the aperture
        flags; % if any of the measurements (1st or 2nd order) don't make sense, it is flagged by the photometry pipeline.
