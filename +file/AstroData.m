classdef AstroData < dynamicprops
% Contains all the outputs from image analysis (images, cutouts, etc.)
% Since the long and ever expanding list of data products is shared by
% several objects (file.Reader, file.BufferWheel, file.Deflator,
% img.PipeLine, etc.) it is helpful to keep these outputs all in one place.
% 

    properties % these include all the images, cutouts, lightcurves, etc that we use in image analysis
        
        % make sure anything you add is added to clear...
        images; % this is raw images and it is usually what we save on file
%         images_proc; % this is after calibration, subtraction, etc. If no processing is done, put a pointer to the raw data. 
        
        cutouts; % this is raw cutouts and it is usually what we save on file
%         cutouts_proc; % this is after calibration, subtraction, etc. If no processing is done, put a pointer to the raw data. 
        positions; % only for cutouts. a 2xN matrix (X then Y, N is the number of cutouts). 
        
        cutouts_bg; % samples of the raw images at random locations to calculate the backgrounds
%         bg_cutouts_proc; % this is after calibration, subtraction, etc. If no processing is done, put a pointer to the raw data. 
        positions_bg; % only for bg_cutouts. a 2xN matrix (X then Y, N is the number of cutouts). 
%         backgrounds; % value of the average number of photons per pixel (of the background)
        
        stack % sum of the full frame image
%         stack_proc; % this is after calibration, subtraction, etc. If no processing is done, put a pointer to the raw data. 
        num_sum; % if the images are summed, how many frames were added. If equal to 1, the sum is the same as the images. 
        
        timestamps; % output timestamps (if available)
        t_start; % absolute date and time (UTC) when first image is taken
        t_end; % absolute date and time (UTC) when batch is finished
        t_end_stamp; % timestamp when batch is finished (hopefully, this is the same time that t_end is recorded). 
                
        psfs; % output PSFs from file (if available)
        sampling_psf; % if loaded PSFs need to be binned (this is the binning factor)
        
        lightcurves; % amount of light (total) in each cutout.
