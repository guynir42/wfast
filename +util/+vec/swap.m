function [b, a] = swap(a, b)
% Usage: [b, a] = swap(a, b)
% Takes the variable in "a" and the variable in "b" and returns them in 
% reverse order. This is a quick and easy way to exchange the value of two 
% variables without needing a temporary value. 
%
% This function has no body. That's pretty neat. I can't take credit, though:
