function [M, b] = flux2lup(flux, b)
% Usage: [M, b] = flux2lup(flux, b)
% Turn flux measurements into Luptitudes (inverse sine magnitudes). 
% These are similar to regular magnitudes, but close to zero flux
% They behave linearly instead of logarithmically. 
% This handles zero and negative fluxes rather gracefully. 
% The second input "b" is the softening parameter, that should be close
% to the flux noise level ("one sigma"). 
% If it is left empty, we use the median value of the std of each flux.
