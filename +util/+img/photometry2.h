/* Usage: [outputs, arrays] = photometry2(cutouts, varargin)

Optional arguments: 
		*index: choose the photometry object number out of the array (index starts at 1!). 
		        This save preallocation of output arrays if you use photometry on different sized datasets in sequence. 
		*aperture or radius: a vector of aperture radii to be used for
                            aperture photometry (in pixels!). The biggest 
                            radius is also used for recentering (see
                            below) and for forced photometry. 
                            Default is [5,7,9].
       *gauss_sigma: the width of the gaussian used in PSF photometery.
                     Default is 2 pixels. 
       *annulus: a one or two element vector for the inner and outer
                 radius of the background annulus. If second element is
                 not given or is smaller than the first, assume it is
                 infinite (so all pixels above the first radius are used).
       *gain: This is used only to estimate the errors from source noise.
              Default is 1. 
       *scintillation_fraction: Used to estimate the additional noise
                                caused by intensity scintillation. This
                                also only affects error estimates. 
                                Default is 0.
       *resolution: How many shifts are needed for all the different
                    apertures/annuli/PSFs. When resolution is 1 (default)
                    the different masks are moved in steps of single
                    pixels, and if resolution is bigger than 1, use more
                    steps inside each pixel for the relative shifts of the
                    masks. The default is 1 but 2 is also a good choice,
                    and I don't think we need more than that.
                    Use only integer values. 
       *threads: how many physical cores should be used to split the work 
                 on different cutouts. For serious computers we should see
                 a speedup proportional to the number of threads for at
                 least threads<5. Default is 1 (no multithreading). 
       *iterations: How many repositions of the gaussians are used on each
                    cutout before settling on the results. Default: 2.
       *use_centering_aperture: If true, use a an aperture at the position
                                from the raw photometery, just to get a
                                little better positioning before going on
                                to the more narrow gaussian photometry. 
       *use_gaussian: If falue, skip gaussians altogether (default true).
       *use_apertures: If false, skip aperture photometery (default true).
       *use_forced: If false, skip doing forced photometry (default true). 
	   *use_median: If true, use median value of annulus pixels to calculate
                    the background (instead of mean). Default true. 
       *use_positives: when calculating the widths (2nd moments), turn any 
                      negative values in the cutout up to zero, to prevent
                      unphysical results like negative 2nd moments. 
       *debug_bit: Level of verbosity of the code (default: 0). 

For more information about how to use this function, see photometry2.m

Updates:
2020-08-04 Guy: added option "use_positives" to make 2nd moment calculation only use non-negative values. 

2020-02-27 Guy: Added multiple objects in global scope, added parseIndex method to find which one to use. 
                This prevents users that do photometry on multiple data sets of differing size from resetting
				the whole preallocation mechanisms. 
				E.g., one photometry object is used for stack photometry and one for full-cutouts. 
				This way no need to reallocate the data twice each batch.

/*
Additional developer notes:
This code has been optimized so it can run live on W-FAST, 
producing photometry live for thousands of stars, on a 100
frames every 4 seconds. 
To that end it uses some nasty programming tricks I will 
try to outline here.

*Preallocating everything in a global object:
In the beginning of the photometry.cpp file there is a declaration
"Photometry photometry;"
This object is allocated and remains in matlab's memory until:
a) The file is compiled again. 
b) Use "clear mex".
c) Matlab exits. 
Therefore all the initializations should happen only once per session. 
These include making the aperture, annulus and gaussian masks, 
the indices lists for the aperture and annulus masks, 
the average arrays and the output arrays. 

*Keeping indices of each mask:
The annulus and aperture masks are logical, 
so we can keep them as a sparse list of 
indices to all the "true" positions. 
These are saved as "aperture_indices" and "annulus_indices". 
When summing over the cutout, we only need to sum the length 
of each such vector, not the size of the entire cutout. 

*Dividing the work to units of single cutouts:
Most of the work done on each cutout is done together. 
With the exception of forced photometry, we run all 
calculations on one cutout before going to the next. 
This allows the CPU to keep in memory the image cutout
we are working on at the moment, and it doesn't need 
to jump around, picking up memory from the entire 
cutouts matrix. 
The forced photometry is done in the same cutout by cutout
way but only after all the other photometry types are done. 
This is because we need to get all the offsets and average 
them before calculating the forced photometry. 

*Multithreading:
Because we handle each cutout independently (with the 
exception of forced photometry), then we can easily split
the work into multiple threads. Each thread gets a distinct
list of cutouts to work on by itself. Since all the threads
need to access existing memory, and do not need to allocate
any memory, there is little overhead to running multiple threads. 

The new computer manages to run 1000 cutouts of 13x13 pixels, 
using 6 cores to do the photometry, at 25 Hz. 

*Using value==value to check if a pixel is NaN:
Turns out that "isnan()" is a really slow function. 
Since every sum we do on the cutouts must check each pixel 
for being NaN (as this is how we mark bad pixels) this test
becomes very expensive. Luckily we can reduce the runtime
dramatically by just comparing array[i]==array[i]. If the 
pixel value is NaN, it will return false even when compared 
to itself. Other values will return true. I haven't tested this
on weird values like Inf, but we don't expect to see those in 
the images. 

*Using the results of one aperture to calculate the next (bigger) one: 
The aperture photometry does concentric apertures with progressively 
larger sizes (wedding cake), that can later be used either to either
choose the best aperture per star or to test if the flux fluctuation 
is real or just width/position related. 
To calculate all these apertures quickly we just re-use the result from 
the previous aperture to calculate the next one, needing only to sum 
the pixels that were not included in any of the former apertures.
